This sample is using sqlalchemy as orm, and sqlite as data source.

To run:
1. `setup.py` to set up virtual environment and required dependency 
2. `create_db.py` to create db
3. 'insert_db.py' to insert data to db
4. `read_db.py` to read data from db and print


This is example from (tutorial)[http://pythoncentral.io/introductory-tutorial-python-sqlalchemy/]
